README file for pk2dump
=======================

pk2dump is a library to read the file PK2DeviceFile.dat that is supplied
with PICkit2 utilities. This file contains all the necessary parameters
to successfully program all the supported PICs.

There are two sets of routines, the reading ones and the text output ones.

The reading routines are divided in such a way that allows an external
program to call them and perform the necessary memory allocations.

To allow C++ programs to use these routines, all memory allocation operations
are left out of the library.

The program pk2dump.c has an example of how to read and print the file using
the supplied routines.

Compiling should be as easy as that:

$ gcc -Wall pk2dump.c pickit2dat.c -o pk2dump
